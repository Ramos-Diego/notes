# Manage your node apps

We have been using the root user until now to go through all the configuration easily, but you should not run any application as root. We will create a new user with no root access which will run our node apps.

Add an user in Ubuntu

```sh
adduser [insert-username]
```

Switch to the new user

```sh
su -l [insert-username]
```

`-, -l, --login`: make the shell a login shell

Create the following folder structure in the home directory

```
example.com
├── public
│   └── test.html
└── app.js
```

Create sample static file (test.html)

```html
<!-- ~/node-app/public/test.hmtl -->
<h1>HELLO! NGINX is serving this static file (test.html)</h1>
```

This file will be available at `your-domain.com/test.html`

Create simple test app

```js
// ~/node-app/app.js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

// Send a message
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.json({ message: 'Hello world!' }))

// Start listening on localhost:8080
app.listen(8080, 'localhost')
```

This message will be available at `your-domain.com`. The reason for this can be found in the NGINX configuration. In there we setup a reverse proxy which redirects requests on PORT :80 or :443 to :8080 in the loopback interface.

Install dependencies

```sh
cd ~/node-app/
```

```sh
yarn add express
```

Start the app using PM2

```sh
pm2 start app.js --name example.com -i max
```

Note that in order to have 0-downtime deployment your server must have a minimun of 2 CPUs

Go to your domain and test the app.

Save the current pm2 configuration to be initiated on reboot

```sh
pm2 save
```

Get the script need to enable PM2 to startup on boot

```sh
pm2 startup
```

Copy and paste the command provided by PM2.

```
...
[PM2] To setup the Startup Script, copy/paste the following command:
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/local/share/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u user --hp /home/user
```

You can switch back to the root user by loggin out of the current user and run the PM2 command from there

```sh
exit
```

Test by restarting the server

As `root`

```sh
reboot
```
